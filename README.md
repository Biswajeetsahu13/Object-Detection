# 🎯 Object Detection with Deep Learning

This project showcases an object detection system using a deep learning model to detect and classify objects in images or video streams. Built in a Jupyter Notebook, the implementation includes model loading, image preprocessing, detection visualization, and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Pre-trained object detection model (e.g., SSD, YOLO, or Faster R-CNN)
- ✅ Real-time object localization with bounding boxes
- ✅ Confidence scores for each detection
- ✅ Easy-to-use Jupyter Notebook format
- ✅ Customizable for other datasets

## 📁 File Overview

- Object_Detection.ipynb – Main notebook containing all steps from importing the model to detection visualization.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on model used)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- NumPy
